# Setup Guide

This guide walks you through installing, configuring, and running the Fenger Management System.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (latest version recommended)
- A Google Sheet with the expected columns (for Sumo / sheet integration)
- (Optional) An RvB scoring server on the same network (for Red vs Blue mode)

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the repository** to your local machine.

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

   This installs Bun type definitions and TypeScript support. No heavy frameworks or build tools are required.

## Running the Server

### Development (with hot reload)

```bash
bun --hot index.ts
```

The `--hot` flag automatically restarts the server when you change `index.ts`, `handlers.ts`, or imported HTML files.

### Production / Standalone

You can compile to a standalone executable:

```bash
bun build --compile index.ts --target=bun-windows-x64-modern --outfile sumo
```

Then run the binary directly:

```bash
./sumo
```

## Default URLs

Once the server is running, the following URLs are available:

| URL | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `http://localhost:3000/` | Admin control panel |
| `http://localhost:3000/overlay` | OBS Browser Source overlay |
| `http://localhost:3000/api/state` | Full state JSON (GET/POST) |

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Bun automatically loads `.env` files. You can create a `.env` file in the project root to override defaults:

```env
# Optional: override the port (default 3000)
PORT=8080
```

> **Note:** The Apps Script URL and token are hardcoded in `index.ts`. If you need to change them, edit the source directly:
> - `APPS_SCRIPT_BASE` — the Google Apps Script web app URL
> - `TOKEN` — the shared secret for Apps Script authentication

### Google Sheets Integration

The Apps Script (`apps-script.gs`) reads from a Google Spreadsheet. To use your own sheet:

1. Create a new Google Sheet with the expected columns (see below).
2. Open **Extensions > Apps Script** and paste the contents of `apps-script.gs`.
3. Update `SPREADSHEET_ID` in the script to your sheet's ID.
4. Deploy the script as a **Web app** (Execute as: Me, Access: Anyone).
5. Copy the deployed URL and update `APPS_SCRIPT_BASE` in `index.ts`.

#### Expected Sheet Structure

**Sheet: "All Matches"**

| Column | Header |
|--------|--------|
| A | Match # |
| B | Red Team #1 |
| C | Robot Name RT1 |
| D | Team Members RT1 |
| E | Blue Team #1 |
| F | Robot Name BT1 |
| G | Team Members BT1 |
| H | Red Team #2 |
| I | Robot Name RT2 |
| J | Team Members RT2 |
| K | Blue Team #2 |
| L | Robot Name BT2 |
| M | Team Members BT2 |
| ... | Winner |
| ... | Blue Sumo Win |
| ... | Red Sumo Win |
| ... | Blue Balls |
| ... | Red Balls |
| ... | Blue Auto Balls |
| ... | Red Auto Balls |
| ... | Blue Goal Penalty |
| ... | Red Goal Penalty |

**Sheet: "P8 Sumo Next Plays"**

| Column | Header |
|--------|--------|
| ... | Team # |

Row 2 = Red on-deck, Row 3 = Blue on-deck.

### RvB Scoring Server

For Red vs Blue mode, an external scoring server must be reachable on port `8080`. The server must implement:

- `GET /scores` — returns current match scores and state
- `POST /action` — accepts scoring actions

See [RvB-API.md](../RvB-API.md) in the project root for the full protocol.

Enter the server's IP or hostname in the RvB admin panel (e.g., `10.0.0.42` or `fms-scoring.local`).

## OBS Setup

1. In OBS, add a **Browser Source** to your scene.
2. Set the URL to `http://localhost:3000/overlay`.
3. Set width and height to match your canvas (e.g., 1920x1080).
4. The overlay background is transparent, so it will composite cleanly over your camera feed.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `bun: command not found` | Install Bun from [bun.sh](https://bun.sh) |
| Port 3000 is in use | Kill the other process or change the port in `index.ts` |
| Sheet load fails | Verify the Apps Script URL and that the sheet is publicly readable by the script |
| RvB scores don't update | Check that the RvB server IP is correct and port 8080 is open |
| Overlay not showing in OBS | Ensure the Browser Source URL is correct and the server is running |
